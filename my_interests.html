            <h2>Asian Culture</h2>

            <p>I've always been interested in learning more about the culture from which I came. I currently serve as the president for the Asian-American Culture Club at my school and work to create an environment that celebrates Asian culture and explores the experience of the Asian-American.</p>

            <h2>Music Review</h2>
            
            <p>I own a music review account where I review shoegaze, experimental hip-hop, and rock of all forms. I have been the 6th most acclaimed music reviewer on the site and boast top reviews on tens of albums. My favorite album is <i>Twin Fantasy</i> (2018) by Will Toledo. </p>

            <h2>Data Science</h2>
            
            <p>I have always been interested in numbers and Big Data and how they affect the real world. I studied machine learning and statistics at Stanford. Through my leadership role on robotics, I have assembled the largest scouting system and took the most data points (in the tens of millions) for Team 2485.</p>
