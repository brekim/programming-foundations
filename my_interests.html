            <caption>My co-president Alanis and I give a workshop on Asian-American identity at our school.</caption>

            <p>I've always been interested in learning more about the culture from which I came. I currently serve as the president for the Asian-American Culture Club at my school and work to create an environment that celebrates Asian culture and explores the experience of the Asian-American.</p>

            <h2>Data Science</h2>
            
            <p>I have always been interested in numbers and Big Data and how they affect the real world. I studied machine learning and statistics in a pre-collegiate summer program at Stanford University. Through my leadership role on robotics, I have assembled the <b>largest scouting alliance</b> and <b>aggregated the most data points</b> (in the tens of millions) in FRC history.</p>
